        setTimeout(this.scroll, 0); //This is a workaround React's error that you should only set the state using the setState method. This allows state to update and captures the face that window.scrollTo(0,0) needs to happen after the setState's parent function has returned. Previously I'd tried setting testComplete in the earlier conditional statement that checks to make sure that each of eI, sN, tF and jP don't equal zero. This worked because by the time setState was run testComplete was already true and so window.scrollTo(0,0) would happen but, though it worked, React put an error in the console. Naturally, I made a temporary version of testComplete within the scope of handleSubmit later to be updated when setState was called to see if this would fix the console error, which it did, but then my window.scrollTo(0,0) line wasn't running on the condition that testComplete was true. Why? What I learned empirically is that in React the setState method doesn't actually update state until its parent function has returned, so setting testComplete in my setState method wasn't working to trigger window.scrollTo(0,0) because when it was hitting the window.scrollTo(0,0) line testComplete was still either undefined or false in state. What worked was of course allowing state to update with setState, binding a function containing window.scrollTo(0,0) to the constructor and calling it from a setTimeout after setState so that after setState's parent function had returned, i.e. after state was actually set, the scroll function would have the updated version of state and be able to scroll if {testComplete: true} or not scroll if {testComplete: undefined} or {testComplete: false}

    }

    scroll() {
        if (this.state.testComplete === true) {
            window.scrollTo(0,0); //When submit is handled scroll to the top of "the new page." Because this is really the same page with visibility toggled, if this code isn't included in the submit handler the window will simply remain scrolled to the bottom of the page where it currently is (where the button is) when the button is clicked/submit is handled.
